    "### Issues covered:\n",
    "- Search for and request data from a public STAC catalogue of satellite imagery\n",
    "- Download satellite imagery as raster data \n",
    "- Read rasters into python using the rioxarray package\n",
    "- Visualise single/multi-band raster data\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A number of satellites take snapshots of the Earth’s surface from space. The images recorded by these remote sensors represent a very precious data source for any activity that involves monitoring changes on Earth. Satellite imagery is typically provided in the form of geospatial raster data, with the measurements in each grid cell (“pixel”) being associated to accurate geographic coordinate information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook exercise we will explore how to access open satellite data using Python. In particular, we will consider [the Sentinel-2 data collection that is hosted on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/sentinel-2-l2a-cogs). This dataset consists of multi-band optical images acquired by the two satellites of [the Sentinel-2 mission](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-2) and it is continuously updated with new images.\n",

    "**The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification**\n",
    "\n",
    "Current sensor resolutions and satellite revisit periods are such that terabytes of data products are added daily to the corresponding collections. Such datasets cannot be made accessible to users via full-catalog download. Space agencies and other data providers often offer access to their data catalogs through interactive Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), see for instance the [Copernicus Open Access Hub portal](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/dhus/#/home) for the Sentinel missions. Accessing data via a GUI is a nice way to explore a catalog and get familiar with its content, but it represents a heavy and error-prone task that should be avoided if carried out systematically to retrieve data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A service that offers programmatic access to the data enables users to reach the desired data in a more reliable, scalable and reproducible manner. An important element in the software interface exposed to the users, which is generally called the Application Programming Interface (API), is the use of standards. Standards, in fact, can significantly facilitate the reusability of tools and scripts across datasets and applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) specification is an emerging standard for describing geospatial data. By organizing metadata in a form that adheres to the STAC specifications, data providers make it possible for users to access data from different missions, instruments and collections using the same set of tools.\n",

    "\n",
    "Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs (COGs) are regular GeoTIFF files with some additional features that make them ideal to be employed in the context of cloud computing and other web-based services. This format builds on the widely-employed GeoTIFF format, which you can find out more about in [Episode 1: Introduction to Raster Data](01-intro-raster-data.md). In short, a GeoTIFF is a standard .tif image format with additional spatial (georeferencing) information embedded in the file as tags. These tags should include the following raster metadata:\n",
    "- Extent\n",
    "- Resolution\n",
    "- Coordinate Reference System (CRS)\n",
    "- Values that represent missing data (NoDataValue)\n",
    "\n",
    "COGs, by extension, are regular GeoTIFF files with a special internal structure. One of the features of COGs is that data is organized in \"blocks\" that can be accessed remotely via independent HTTP requests. Data users can thus access the only blocks of a GeoTIFF that are relevant for their analysis, without having to download the full file. In addition, COGs typically include multiple lower-resolution versions of the original image, called \"overviews\", which can also be accessed independently. By providing this \"pyramidal\" structure, users that are not interested in the details provided by a high-resolution raster can directly access the lower-resolution versions of the same image, significantly saving on the downloading time. More information on the COG format can be found [here](https://www.cogeo.org).\n",

    "So far, we have visualized a band of a Sentinel-2 scene and calculated its statistics. However, we need to take missing data into account. Raster data often has a \"no data value\" associated with it and for raster datasets read in by `rioxarray`. This value is referred to as `nodata`. This is a value assigned to pixels where data is missing or no data were collected. There can be different cases that cause missing data, and it's common for other values in a raster to represent different cases. The most common example is missing data at the edges of rasters.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default the shape of a raster is always rectangular. So if we have a dataset that has a shape that isn't rectangular, some pixels at the edge of the raster will have no data values. This often happens when the data were collected by a sensor which only flew over some part of a defined region.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen above, the `nodata` value of this dataset (`raster_ams_b9.rio.nodata`) is 0. When we have plotted the band data, or calculated statistics, the missing value was not distinguished from other values. Missing data may cause some unexpected results. For example, the 25th percentile we just calculated was 0, probably reflecting the presence of a lot of missing data in the raster.\n",
